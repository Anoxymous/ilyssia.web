					<p class="text-abstract">
						Welcome to the space where our love story lives—from dusty 4x4 tracks on Moreton Island to moonlit nursery cuddles and everything in between.
						<br><br>
						We met unexpectedly, fell in love deliberately, and built a life both wild and wonderful. On 26 September 2026, we’ll marry between sunset and moonrise—a symbol of transition, of rhythm, of our ongoing adventure.
						<br><br>
						This isn’t the beginning or the end—it’s the moment in between where we choose each other, fully, and invite you to witness it.

				<p class="text-section-heading">Our Story</p>
				<div class="section-content">
					<p class="text-section-sub-heading">How We Met</p>
					<p class="text-quotes">Once upon a beach…</p>
					<p class="text-body">
						We moved in the same circles for years. Same events. Same adventures. Shared friends. And yet somehow, we never met. Not once.
						<br><br>
						You’d think fate would’ve thrown us together at a hiking adventure, a climbing event, or a barbecue. But no. It waited. Quietly. Patiently. Watching us orbit each other like two celestials under the same sky.
						<br><br>
						Until one day, on a 4x4 trip to Moreton Island—salt in the air, sand under our wheels—we finally collided. We didn’t know it then, but that moment would mark the last day we were strangers. It wasn’t love at first sight. It was something quieter. Slower. Like a tide rolling in. Not in a dramatic, slow-motion way. Just a quiet, curious moment that changed everything.
						<br><br>
						There was laughter. There was a connection. There was something neither of us could quite explain—something warm and calm and familiar, like finding a piece of home you didn’t know you were missing. That trip became the prologue to everything.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text-section-sub-heading">The Proposal</p>
					<p class="text-quotes">High above the world, love found its voice.</p>
<!--					<p class="text-quotes">Above the clouds, a quiet (and slightly chaotic) promise.</p> -->
					<p class="text-body">
						Fast forward to Japan. Snow falling gently. The summit of Maiko Ski Resort stretched out in panoramic silence. It was breathtaking. Timy had a plan to propose at the top, surrounded by clouds and mountains. Romantic. Serene. Perfect.
						<br><br>
						Except… there was Michelle—bundled head to toe in full ski gear, determined to look cool in the summit photos. Helmet on. Goggles on. Gloves secured. Hood cinched tight. She was fully committed to the ski aesthetic.
						<br><br>
						Timy, meanwhile, was gently—and repeatedly—trying to undress Michelle. First, he tried to remove her gloves. She said, “No, my hands will freeze.” Then, he reached for her goggles. “Absolutely not, they look amazing.” Then the helmet. “Why do you want to ruin the photo?”
						<br><br>
						All he managed to remove successfully were her skis (which, in hindsight, was probably a safety precaution in case she panicked and skied away.) Still, despite the layers and the stubbornness, he got down on one knee—Michelle looking like a cool snow trooper—and asked the question that changed everything.
						<br><br>
						She said yes. Helmet and all. And honestly? It was perfectly us—a little clumsy, heartfelt, and completely unforgettable.
					</p>
					<p class="text-section-sub-heading">Why Sunset–Moonrise?</p>
					<p class="text-quotes">Because the in-between is where the magic lives.</p>
					<p class="text-body">
						Just like us orbiting and finally coming together, we have chosen one of the rare days when the sun and moon conjoin. We chose to be married at sunset—not because it's the end of something, but because it's the most beautiful transition the world offers. The golden hour when everything softens. The moment when light leans into shadow.
						<br><br>
						There’s also something quietly cosmic about it (a little nod to Timy’s quiet fascination with space). He’s always wanted the moon to be part of the wedding, and honestly… so did I.
						<br><br>
						Our sunset marks the closing of two solo paths. Moonrise begins the journey of one shared life. This ceremony isn’t about a fairytale ending or a perfect beginning. It’s about honouring what brought us here and stepping into whatever comes next, moonlit, messy, and meaningful. It’s a rhythm, like our love—gentle, grounded, and full of wonder.
					</p>

					<p class="text-section-sub-heading">Baby Blip</p>
					<p class="text-quotes">Our littlest light in the moonlight.</p>
					<p class="text-body">
						Between the proposal and the wedding, life gave us our greatest adventure yet—our baby girl, Ilyssia. Fondly known as “Blip” during her journey to us, a small nickname for the tiny soul that made a big entrance.
						<br><br>
						She’s already stolen our sleep, our hearts, and the dance floor. 
						<br><br>
						Having her in our arms as we say our vows feels like the final line of a chapter we never knew we were writing. She is the proof of our love’s becoming—part of our story, our ceremony, and our forever.

						Think <b>sunset and starlight</b> for your palette — rich golds, soft blush and rose, warm amber, twilight navy, deep plum, silver, and midnight blue. A touch of shimmer or celestial sparkle is welcome.
						<br><br>					 
						<b>Men:</b> suits or jackets in classic or evening tones such as navy, charcoal, or sand, with optional accents in sunset or moonlight hues.

						<b>Women:</b> formal or floor-length dresses in sunset-inspired shades or luminous metallics (gold, champagne, copper, silver, or deep celestial blues).

				<div class="section-content">
					<p class="text-section-heading">Questions &amp; Answers</p>
					<p class="intro-quote">Sunset sealed our past, moonrise begins our forever.</p>
<!--					<p class="text-section-sub-heading">Where is the ceremony and reception taking place?</p> -->
					<p class="text-body">
						<b>Q: What’s happening before the ceremony?</b><br><br>
						We’ve planned a relaxed, fun lead-up to the ceremony. Arrive early and enjoy:
						<br> - Delicious grazing tables
						<br> - Garden games and activities
						<br> - Time to catch up, sip something cool, and ease into the evening
						<br> - This isn’t just a wedding—it’s a celebration from the moment you arrive.

						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: What is a blessing ceremony?</b><br><br>
						As we're doing things a little in reverse, we wanted an option to make our arrival that little bit special. A blessing ceremony is a ritual for welcoming the couple, to give blessings and best wishes and can involve audience participation.
						<br><br>
						Our vision is for this to be symbolic of welcoming the bride/groom into your family or friendship circle. Just before we arrive, guests will gather around, forming a pathway to the centre of our celebrations. As we enter and procceed down the path, guests can give their blessings. A hug, kiss on the cheek or a few words is all the token required.
						
						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Will there be food and drinks?</b><br><br>
						Absolutely! We’ll have delicious bites and flowing drinks from dusk into the night. Think shared feasting, twilight toasts, and delicious treats under the stars.
						<br><br>
						Pre-ceremony, grazing food platters will be provided and drinks will be available for purchase.
						<br><br>
						Post-vows feasting will be a sit-down alternate drop menu and a bar tab will start from 5:45 PM.
						<br><br>
						Let us know any dietary requirements in your RSVP.

						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Will there be dancing?</b><br><br>
						We wouldn’t be us without dancing. Once the vows are spoken and the stars come out, the dance floor opens. We’ll dance from moonrise to midnight, or until our feet (and our baby girl) tell us it’s time to call it a night.
						
						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Can I bring my children, or a Plus One?</b><br><br>
						While we would love to have everyone attend, we unfortunately have strict numbers for the reception. Guests are named in the RSVP, with some allowance for those travelling from overseas. No children or additional plus ones, unless specified.
						<br><br>
						However, your children will be more then welcome to join us for our post wedding gathering the following day.
						
						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Can I take photos during the ceremony?</b><br><br>
						We’re having an unplugged ceremony—meaning phones and cameras away, hearts fully present. We’ve hired a photographer to capture every moment, so you can just sit back, soak in the magic, and relive it all later. Snap away during the reception and pre-ceremony celebrations though!

						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Is there a registry?</b><br><br>
						There's no registry. We already have all we need and are so grateful simply to have you celebrate with us. But if you’d like to give something more, we’d love your help fueling our next adventure as a family. We will have a wishing well at the wedding for cards, heartfelt notes, and any contributions toward our future travels, memories, and maybe a date night or two.
						<br><br>
						<b>Absolutely no gift cards, please.</b> Timy hates them with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. (Trust us, it’s a thing.) Cash or a simple note will make him infinitely happier—and us endlessly grateful.
						<br><br>
						No pressure, no expectations, just lots of love and laughter.
						
						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: When do I have to RSVP by?</b><br><br>

						Please let us know by 4th Jan 2026.
						<br><br>
						You can RSVP via <a href="https://withjoy.com/michelle-and-timothy-sep-26/rsvp">withjoy.com</a> or message us directly so we can mark you as attending.

						<br><br><br>
						<b>Q: Will there be post wedding festivities?</b><br><br>
						Absolutely! We’re planning a relaxed post-wedding gathering the next day so everyone can unwind, mingle, and soak up a little extra celebration. We’ll share the location and details closer to the date—stay tuned!
						<!-- 
					  <br><br><br>
						<b>What's the meaning behind the sunset–moonrise theme?</b><br><br>
						Our love story began in the soft light of chance—not a lightning strike, but a slow unfolding.
						<br><br>
						This ceremony celebrates that: the in-between, the becoming. The sunset marks the ending of two solo paths; the moonrise, the beginning of a shared one. It’s not about ever after. It’s about ever evolving, together.
